# Integrated-Data-Lifestyle-Management
## Overview

**Brilliantworks** is a leading beverage and confectionery retailer in North America, well-known for their wide range of products sold through a chain of physical stores. A few years ago, Brilliantworks began its digital transformation, shifting focus to online channels to broaden their market reach and drive profitability. Today, the online division has become a key driver for both sales volume and profitability.

Brilliantworks has been a long-time customer of TD Company, utilizing its corporate warehouse and advanced analytics solutions to drive business decisions. Recently, they transitioned their data operations to the cloud, adopting a **Multi-Cloud** strategy to ensure operational efficiency, agility, and reduce the risk of vendor lock-in.

The IT team has implemented ** Teradata Vantage Enterprise** on both Azure and AWS, complemented by a **Lake Edition** with **Query Grid Fabric** that seamlessly connects the cloud environments. The ecosystem also increasingly leverages object storage to optimize storage costs, and new data feeds are regularly ingested using advanced data types. 

Brilliantworks has also enhanced several applications, such as their Call Center, which now operates using a real-time and event-driven data approach. As the business scales, the need for consistent, high-quality data, as well as performance monitoring and optimization, is crucial for maintaining a competitive edge.

## Project Objective
To meet the business objectives of near real-time data availability and enhancing application performance, this project focuses on integrating diverse data sources, standardizing data, and ensuring data quality across the BrilliantWorks multi-cloud environment.

## Functional Requirements
**Transformation to Online Sales:**  Support the companyâ€™s growing e-commerce division by providing real-time insights and performance metrics.

**New 3rd Party Feeds Ingestion:** Ingest and process external data sources to provide richer insights.
